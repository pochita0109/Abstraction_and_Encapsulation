# ABSTRACTION AND ENCAPSULATION

- This project used Object-Oriented Programming and applied two of the four pillars of OOP, which are abstraction and encapsulation.
For this project, it has three (3) programs, one for a fan, one for a car, and one for a pet. Each program has separate folders and the files are located inside of it. All of the programs have private instance variables, as it is one of the principles of encapsulation.

FAN PROGRAM
- This program has a fan object embedded with four different attributes: speed, switch, radius, and color. by entering the values needed, the result will look like the picture below:

CAR PROGRAM
- This program has a car object with three attributes which are year, make, and speed. It also has a method by which the car will accelerate by 5 each time you call accelerate method and decelerate by 5 each time you call brake. The result will look like this:

PET PROGRAM
- This program has a pet object with three attributes, which are name, type, and age. In this program, the user will be asked to enter '
their pet's name, type, and age. After entering it, the program will show the result like this:
